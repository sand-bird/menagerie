*Menagerie* is a virtual-pet simulation game about cultivating magical flora and fauna in a zoological garden. 

*Menagerie* is a love letter to games like *Creatures*, *Viva Piñata*, *The Sims*, *Pokémon*, *Animal Crossing: New Leaf*, and *Sonic Adventure 2*'s Chao Garden.

*Menagerie* aims to give the player a chunk of space they can express themselves in, fill it with virtual pets that are smart enough to seem endearingly lifelike, and stick it in the middle of a world they'll want to come back to.

## Story

Shortly before you were born, the Astromancers made the breakthrough of an era: a spell to create a stable portal across any distance, as long as the mages on either side can work in perfect sync. It sparked an age of unprecedented expansion and discovery. Brave explorers set out farther than anyone had ever dared, and one by one, portals winked open on a vast frontier brimming with mysterious magic. The Far Lands beckoned to the curious, the adventurous, and the entrepreneurial; colonies and outposts quickly proliferated, many bearing the flag of your proud kingdom.

You've just completed your training at the Royal Academy, and -- due to your talent, no doubt, though your friendship with the Prince couldn't have hurt either -- you have been granted an enviable assignment: to settle in Placeholder, the kingdom's premier outpost in the Far Lands, where you will tame, study, and raise exotic fauna on behalf of the crown. This is no mere zookeeping job: monsters from the Far Lands are prized, especially if well-raised, and make valuable political gifts or additions to the Royal Menagerie. Do well, and you might just go down in history...
